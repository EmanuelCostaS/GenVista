# GenVista 
> Crafting Diverse Synthetic Worlds for AI Perception.

---

## Overview

GenVista is an open-source, Unity-based framework for generating diverse, richly annotated **synthetic datasets**. It aims to help ML, robotics, and computer vision developers create customizable 3D scenes and simulate sensor outputs to accelerate AI model development. Our mission is to provide a versatile, community-driven tool for a wide array of perception tasks. It has just started, but it will be upgraded from time to time.

## Core Features

*   **Versatile 3D Environments**: Create/customize urban, natural, or indoor scenes. (TBD)
*   **Customizable Sensors**: Simulate cameras (RGB, depth, segmentation) with extensibility for more. (TBD)
*   **Rich Annotations**: Auto-generate 2D/3D bounding boxes, semantic/instance masks, and depth maps. (TBD)
*   **Domain Randomization**: Tools to vary textures, lighting, and object placements. (TBD)
*   **Unity Powered**: Leverages Unity for high-fidelity rendering and physics.
*   **Scripting & Extensibility**: Full programmatic control and modular design for community contributions.
*   **Detailed Atmosphere**: Thanks to [Tenkoku Dynamic Sky](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/particles-effects/tenkoku-dynamic-sky-34435), it is simple to edit the weather conditions.

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites**: Unity Hub, Unity Editor (2022.3 LTS+), Git.
2.  **Clone**: `git clone https://github.com/EmanuelCostaS/GenVista.git` 
3.  **Open in Unity**: Use Unity Hub to open the cloned project.

## Showcase

*(To be added.)*

## Potential Applications

*   Generating datasets to train object detectors for autonomous systems (vehicles, drones).
*   Developing perception algorithms for robotics in varied environments.
*   Generating large-scale datasets for computer vision research (segmentation, depth estimation).
*   Prototyping 3D assets and environments for simulations or VR/AR.
*   Supplementing real-world data to improve model generalization.
